# Python-OOP
The course "Python OOP" we learned the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), to work with classes and objects, to use object-oriented modeling and to build hierarchies of classes. We studied the basic principles of OOP such as abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes), encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. We entered the most frequently used design patterns (creational, structural and behavioral design patterns). We were introduced to the SOLID principles for object-oriented software design. We learned what iterators and generators are and how to use them. We learned how to create and use decorators. We wrote component testing (writing unit tests) and the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD). <br>
