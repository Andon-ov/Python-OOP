# Upon initialization the class will receive the following parameters: name: str. Each equipment should also have an id (autoincremented, starting from 1). To do the incrementation you should create a class attribute id equal to 1, which will keep the value of the id for the next equipment's id.
# Create a method called get_next_id which returns the id that will be given to the next equipment.
# Implement the __repr__ method so it returns the info about the equipment in the following format: "Equipment <{id}> {name}"
# Create a static method called get_next_id which returns the id that will be given to the next equipment.
