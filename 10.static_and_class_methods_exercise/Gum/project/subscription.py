# Upon initialization the class will receive the following parameters: date:str, customer_id: int, trainer_id: int, exercise_id: int. The class should also have an id (autoincremented starting from 1). To do the incrementation you should create a class attribute id equal to 1, which will keep the value of the id for the next subscription's id.
# Implement the __repr__ method so it returns the info about the subscription in the following format: "Subscription <{id}> on {date}"
# Create a static method called get_next_id which returns the id that will be given to the next subscription
