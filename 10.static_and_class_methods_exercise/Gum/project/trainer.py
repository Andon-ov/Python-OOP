# Upon initialization the class will receive the following parameters: name:str. The class should also have an id (autoincremented starting from 1). To do the incrementation you should create a class attribute id equal to 1, which will keep the value of the id for the next trainer's id.
# Implement the __repr__ method so it returns the info about the trainer in the following format: "Trainer <{id}> {name}"
# Create a static method called get_next_id which returns the id that will be given to the next trainer.
